Hi there!

I'm Ryan, also known as [Raito Bezarius](https://keybase.io/RaitoBezarius) [over](https://github.com/RaitoBezarius) [Internet](https://twitter.com/Ra1t0_Bezar1us) [^1].

I am not too good with lengthy self-introduction or captivating and engaging description of what I do.

Otherwise, I am one of these tech guys who wants to share more about what they are thinking. Anyway.
I hope this blog will be helpful for you and everyone and I hope that it'll convince **you** to start a blog, yes, you!

El Psy Congroo,
Ryan.

[^1]: There will be a post about the why before, the how, and the why after I have this "Raito Bezarius" nickname following me since 2013.
